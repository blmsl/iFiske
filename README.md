This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myBlank blank
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myBlank` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.



## How to deploy:
1. Run `npm run deploy` in order to bump major, minor or patch
2. Push code to Ionic Pro `git push ionic master`
3. Wait until the code has built on Ionic, then trigger a native build if plugins have changed.
4. If no plugins have changed, deploy to Production in Ionic Pro.

If plugins have changed, you might also need to setup max/min versions or something.
